A very basic calculator that mimics the 'standard' mac/windows calculator using Flask. Users can compute multiple operations while the backend performs the computations.

## Feature requests

-Prevent the user from entering too many operations which could cause an overflow.</br>
-Encode all passthrough from frontend<->backend</br>
-TLS/HTTS ssl</br>
-CSRF Protection</br>
